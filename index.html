            <section id="about-me">

                <p>My name is Melody. I was born in the Philippines and is now currently living in Montana, USA. I am
                    currently working as a Seasonal Tax Preparer. I am also a student at BYU-Pathway studying BS in
                    Software
                    Development to be a Fullstack Developer in the near future. I am married with no kids yet. I love
                    sketching people on my spare time.</p>

                <p class="country-item">The Philippines consists of 7641 islands that cover it geographically. The
                    interesting fact is that
                    about
                    534 islands
                    were founded and added just in 2017, making the total count - 7641. Out of these islands, only 2000
                    are
                    inhabited! Regarded as a social activity, karaoke forms an integral part of the native people's
                    daily
                    life. You can find the
                    karaoke machines even in the most remote and rural parts of the country. The people of the
                    Philippines
                    are very social and always try to be in touch with all the important people in their
                    lives. This habit of theirs has made the entire country's annual text message count jump up to a
                    whopping 142 billion. the Philippines Basketball Association was started after the NBA, the National
                    Basketball Association of North America,
                    and it happens to be the second oldest basketball association in the whole world!</p>
